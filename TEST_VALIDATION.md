### Python Validation
  Python testing was carried out with pep8 in GitPod IDE and [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).
  No errors reported however several notifications of lines being too long. From researching previous student project work
  it is my understanding that this does not indicate invalid code, however a preference of style.

  ## Bugs
  ___

  While testing the comment feature in recipie_content.html, adding one comment to a recipie, I noticed the
  comment counter for this recipie had increased with 10 comments despite only one comment being submitted and awaiting admin approval. On the '/admin' page I confirmed 10 comments awaiting approval.
  No changes to the django code was performed in around the time of this issue and I was not able to reproduce the issue. Potentially this may have been linked to ongoing issues with the Wifi network, to which the computer running the cloud based IDE (GitPod) was connected.
